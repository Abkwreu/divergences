 law_china_feudal_armies_desc:0 "Originally developed by the Yuan, the Ming and latter Shun inherited the Wei-Suo system to help guard it's borders, by creating military households along the frontiers. However it is horribly out of date as soldiers are more loyal to thir officers-latrons rather than the throne and as such uninterested in warfare, preventing any type of efficient mobilisation."

 decline_of_great_shun.1.f:0 "The Great Shun was founded in Xi'an, now known as Chang'an in 1644, by Li Zicheng, a simple peasant leader at the time, during the collapse of Ming. After winning the battle of Shanhai Pass, crushing both the Ming remnants and the Qing, the Shun solidified their control over most of China. However, the Ming retreated to the island of Formosa with other Ming loyalists hiding in the dense mountains of Yunnan, meanwhile Manchuria has been stiffly resisted Shun's attempts to take the region. As time went on, more and more control was delegated to the provincial governments. This has led to a weak ineffective empire that can barely control its own territory, let alone resist the attacks and ambitions of foreigners. During the 3rd invasion of Tungning, the former Ming regained control of much of the coast using the "Kong-Gao" a new breech-loading single-shot rifle, and their grand navy. The chaos in the south was only further exacerbated by this, with various god-worshipping societies forming. Soon, they and all forms of Christianity would be banned. The societies were soon pushed away from the center of Shun power, centralizing in Guangdong, forming an independent republic in a war against the Shun. The Empire is humiliated, weak and divided, our subjects whisper that the mandate has been lost, and our vassals in the south only pay lip service to us. We must centralize the Celestial Empire, reform the military, and build a strong industry if we are to even hold on to our direct lands, regain the rest of our rightful land prove that we are worthy of the Mandate of Heaven!"
