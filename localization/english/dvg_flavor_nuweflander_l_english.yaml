 dvg_nuweflander.1.t: "The Winkelier Uprising"
 dvg_nuweflander.1.d: "The only place in the cape that can produce cash crops, the Landsburgers of Nuweflander quickly became the wealthiest Geus in the cape. When Burgundy raised taxes during the German wars, Landsburger Hendrik van Boetzelaer instigated a rebellion, forcing the Burgundians out and established a council of other Landsburgers known as the Grondraad to rule the new country. Angered by the Grondraad's policies favouring the Landsburgers, a group of artisans, shopkeepers and merchants, known as the Winkeliers, rose up, forcing Hendrik and the Grondraad to flee, before establishing their own republic."
